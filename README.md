# TNSDC
Overview
The program consists of the following components:

Generator Model: A neural network model designed to generate new images resembling handwritten digits. The generator model is trained using the DCGAN architecture, which consists of convolutional layers to learn features and transpose convolutional layers to upsample the generated images.

Training Data: The MNIST dataset is used for training the generator model. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

Training: The generator model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a binary cross-entropy loss function. During training, the model learns to generate realistic digit images by minimizing the difference between the generated images and real digit images from the MNIST dataset.

Generation: Once trained, the generator model can generate new handwritten digit images. Users can specify the number of images they want to generate, and the program will output synthetic digit images resembling those from the MNIST dataset.
